# Sammi.AI

Sammi.AI is an intelligent assistant built from the ground up on Microsoft Azure with integrated Gemini intelligence. It seamlessly orchestrates Azure AI services and Gemini’s advanced reasoning to deliver context-aware insights, dynamic workflows, and natural language interactions.

---

## Architecture

Sammi.AI’s modular design makes it flexible, scalable, and easy to extend. Each component lives in its own container or function, all running on Azure infrastructure and tapping into Gemini’s high-level knowledge stream.

| Component         | Platform/Service         | Purpose                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Sammi Core        | Azure Kubernetes Service | Containerized orchestration and scaling  |
| AI Manager        | Azure OpenAI             | GPT-4 powered language understanding     |
| Gemini Connector  | Google Gemini API        | Enhanced reasoning and factual updates   |
| Workflow Engine   | Azure Logic Apps         | End-to-end automation and orchestration  |
| Web Frontend      | Azure Static Web Apps    | React-based user interface               |

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository  
2. Provision Azure resources with the included ARM/Bicep templates  
3. Configure environment variables for Azure and Gemini credentials  
4. Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service  

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/Sammi.AI.git
cd Sammi.AI

# Deploy Azure infrastructure
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group sammi-rg \
  --template-file infra/main.bicep

# Build and push container images
docker build -t sammi-core:latest ./services/core
docker push <your-registry>/sammi-core:latest

# Deploy to AKS
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

---

## Usage

Once deployed, open the frontend URL (provided by Azure Static Web Apps) to start interacting with Sammi.AI. You can:

- Ask it to summarize documents stored in Azure Blob Storage  
- Trigger event-driven processes via chat commands  
- Extend its capabilities by dropping your own Azure Functions into `./services/plugins`  

---

## Roadmap

- Deepen Gemini integration for domain-specific knowledge  
- Add support for Azure Cognitive Search for enterprise document indexing  
- Implement advanced analytics dashboards using Azure Monitor
